# What It Is and Why

## What It Is

This repository ships a macOS keyboard layout bundle:

- `root/pc-win-de-keyboard.bundle`

Inside the bundle, `German - PC.keylayout` defines the full key mapping using Apple's keyboard layout XML format.

## Why It Exists

When switching between Windows and macOS on German keyboards, special-character key positions often differ. This layout reduces muscle-memory breaks by keeping key positions close to German Windows-PC behavior.

Typical examples are braces and brackets:

- `{` `}` `[` `]` `|` `\\`

## Who It Helps

- Developers switching daily between Windows and macOS
- Users of external German PC keyboards on Macs
- Teams that want a shared, auditable keyboard layout file
